## Homework: Address book

Write a program that keeps a small list of contacts, and looks up a phone number by name.

The program should:

* define a structure called `Contact`, with a `std::string` member `name` and a `std::string` member `phone`
* create an array of three contacts, initialized with brace initialization, with these entries: `Ada` with `555-0101`, `Grace` with `555-0102`, and `Alan` with `555-0103`
* ask for a name, with the prompt `Enter a name: `, and read it with `std::getline`
* use a `for` loop to find the contact with that name, and print `Ada: 555-0101` for a match
* print `No contact named <name>.` when no contact matches

Use `std::flush` on the prompt. The loop should stop at the first match, so think about where a `break` belongs.

### What to check

Try these names:

* `Grace` should print `Grace: 555-0102`
* `alan` should print `Alan: 555-0103`, since the comparison ignores letter case
* `GRACE` should print `Grace: 555-0102`
* `Bob` should print `No contact named Bob.`

The output shows the name as it's stored in the array, not as it was typed. Think about why an address book should match regardless of case, and what a case-sensitive search would make a user do.

### Extensions

* Add a fourth contact through a second structure variable, and check that the search finds it. Think about how many places the array size appears in the program, and whether you can avoid repeating it.
* Print every contact when the name is `all`, using a second loop.

*This exercise is not from the book. It practices the ideas in Chapter 10, with the loops from Chapter 6.*
