## Homework: Highest score

Write a program that stores three scores in an array, and prints the highest.

The program should:

* declare an `int` array with three elements
* ask for each score in turn, with the prompts `Score 1: `, `Score 2: `, and `Score 3: `, and store each one in the array
* compare the three elements, and print `The highest score is 85`, using the highest value

Use `std::flush` on each prompt. You don't need a loop yet, so write out the three reads and the comparisons by hand. An `if` with `else if` works well here, since the highest value can be found with a few comparisons.

### What to check

Try these sets of scores:

* `70`, `85`, `60` should give `85`
* `90`, `90`, `40` should give `90`, since a tie is still a highest score
* `50`, `50`, `50` should give `50`

The tie case matters. Make sure your comparisons don't depend on the scores being different.

### Extensions

* Print the position of the highest score as well, such as `The highest score is 85, in position 2`.
* Add a fourth score, and check that the program still works. What changed?
